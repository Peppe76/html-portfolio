    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>My name is Giuseppe Santoro,<br />
        I am a programming student because I want to achieve my goal in programming: becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.

        I am currently studying the basics of web development with HTML and trying to build my own website:<br />
        How exciting!
